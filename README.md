## App Description
Fit Happens – Because Your Muscles Won’t Grow Themselves  
Tired of wandering the gym like a lost soul? Fit Happens takes the guesswork out of your workouts! Whether you’re looking to crush leg day, build boulder shoulders, or just find a solid full-body burner, we've got you covered.

## Technology Used
This a collaborative MERN-stack, single-page application. We combined a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We utilized ESLint during the development process to ensure precise unform code.
