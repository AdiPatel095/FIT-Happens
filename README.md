# FIT-Happens

## Description
Fit Happens – Because Your Muscles Won’t Grow Themselves  
Tired of wandering the gym like a lost soul? Fit Happens takes the guesswork out of your workouts! Whether you’re looking to crush leg day, build boulder shoulders, or just find a solid full-body burner, we've got you covered. In creating your first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, you’ll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.
